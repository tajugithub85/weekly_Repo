      <h1>Git Branch</h1>
       <p>Before we 'll discurse more detail about the git Branch let's first know what git is all about.</p>
       <p> <strong>Git</strong> is a distributed revision control and source code management system with an emphasis on speed. Git was initially designed and <br> developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development. Git is a free software distributed under the terms of the GNU General<br> Public License version 2. This tutorial explains how to use Git for project version controlin a distributed environment while<br> working on web-based and non web-based applications development. </p>

      <h1><strong>What's Git Branch And what does it do?</strong></h1>
      <p><strong>Git Branch</strong> is a command operation that  allows creating another line of development. We can use this operation to <br>fork off the development process into two different directions.For example, we released a product for 6.0 version <br>and we might want to create a branch so that the development of 7.0 features can be kept separate from<br> 6.0 bug fixes.</p>
      <p><strong>What's does it do</strong> In Git, branches are a part of your everyday develop  ment process. Git branches are effectively a pointer to a snapshot<br> of your changes. When you want to add a new feature or fix a bug—no matter how big or how small—you spawn a new branch to<br> encapsulate your changes.</p>
